**OVERVIEW**

SNP and indel calls from multiple sequence alignment (MSA)

I need to call SNPs in a multiple sequence alignment from several sanger sequencing sequences, but did not find a simple software that can do that, so I just wrote one.

---

**Input**

The only input is a MSA file in fasta format. You can prepare the alignment in many software, such as MEGA and Aliview. Then just save them in fasta format. Some format requirement:

1. The first sequence is the reference.

2. Make sure the alignment has flat ends, that is, equal length for all sequences.

3. Make sure no "-" in the beginning of the alignment, at least for the reference.
